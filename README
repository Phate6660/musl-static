### Description ###
This is an overlay for modifying or adding packages to include include static support.

### Installation ###
You see that musl-static.conf in the repo right? Ok, good. Now here's what you need to do.
Check out /etc/portage/repos.conf, now you have 2 options:
- If it is a file, append the contents of `musl-static.conf to it.
- If it is a directory, copy `musl-static.conf` to it.

After that, all you need to do is: sudo emerge --sync musl-static

### Software ###
Currently, here is what is included:
- libmpdclient
  static lib by default (use dynamic USE flag to build both types of libs), no testing, no documentation
